Right now, some of my managers are only communicated with the tokens via
messages, while others are just directly modifying them.  What's the best
approach?

I don't care to much for the prototype, but I expect this decision to come
back into play once I get to the network code.  When everything goes
through the messenger, it might be easier to decide when updates have to
happen, both on the client and server sides.
